Example formula many system use | server = hash(user) % number of servers

so users are not assigned forever to a server.
they are assigned using formula.
when server count change formula result change then mapping breaks.

how consistent hashing resolves this?

imagine the ring is numbers from 0 to 99.
i will place three servers and three users.

server positions(these are hashed positions ,assume already computed)

s0-10
s1-40 
s2-80

user positions

userA-20
userB-45
userC-90

now map each user

userA(20)-go clockwise :next server at 40 ->s1

userB(45)-next server at 80 -> s2

userC(90)-wrap around to first server at 10 -> s0

now the problem: what if i add a new server s3?

s0-10
s3-30
s1-40 
s2-80

remap users will happen!

userA(20)-go clockwise next is s3(30) -> moved from s1 to s3 !!!

userB(45)-next is s2(80) -> still s2(unchanged) !!!

userC(90)->wrap to s0->still s0 (unchanged) !!!
